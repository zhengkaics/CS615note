This class and homework I build a dns server.
I learn The domain name space consists of a tree of domain names.
A subtree divides into zones.
Each node may contain resource records.

And I learn dns can used for deal with HTTP overload and using round-robin to load balance.

And what is cache and how dns cache can accelerate the speed of client find target server.
And there are 13 root servers in the world. 
And the root server only accept request from their child node. My dns server request root server are not been accepted.
During my set my own dns server I learn  what is DNS amplification attack, 
and I know if I want set up permanent DNS server I need set up a access control list to avoid DNS amplification attack.

And I learn track down packets and identify 3 handshake and the packtes that being sent back and forth and the closing of connection.
