I also learn POP3 and IMAP.
POP3
POP3 stands for Post Office Protocol. 
POP3 allows an email client to download an email from an email server. 
The POP3 protocol is simple and does not offer many features except for download.
IMAP
IMAP stands for Internet Message Access Protocol. 
IMAP shares many similar features with POP3. It, too, is a protocol that an email client can use to download email from an email server. 
However, IMAP includes many more features than POP3. 
The IMAP protocol is designed to let users keep their email on the server. 

SMTP IMAP, POP3 work to together make email work.
You click Send in your email client, say, Outlook Express.
Outlook Express delivers the email to hMailServer using the SMTP protocol.
hMailServer delivers the email to Microsoft's mail server, mail.microsoft.com, using SMTP.
Bill's Mozilla Mail client downloads the email from mail.microsoft.com to his laptop using the POP3 protocol (or IMAP).

And I learn how https works and what the green lock means
When you request a HTTPS connection to a webpage, the website will initially send its SSL certificate to your browser. 
This certificate contains the public key needed to begin the secure session. 
Based on this initial exchange, your browser and the website then initiate the 'SSL handshake'. 
The SSL handshake involves the generation of shared secrets to establish a uniquely secure connection between yourself and the website.

When a trusted SSL Digital Certificate is used during a HTTPS connection, users will see a padlock icon in the browser address bar. 
When an Extended Validation Certificate is installed on a web site, the address bar will turn green.
