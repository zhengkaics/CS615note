And know 
The difference between IPV4 and IPV6 are
IPv4 address scheme allowing for a total of 2^32 addresses.
Written in decimal as four numbers separated by periods. Each number can be 0 to 255.
The number of IPv6 addresses is 10^28  times larger than the number of IPv4 addresses. 
IPv6 addresses are 128-bit IP address written in hexadecimal and separated by colons. 
An example IPv6 address could be written like this: 3ffe:1900:4545:3:200:f8ff:fe21:67cf.

The difference between UDP and TCP are:
Both TCP and UDP are protocols used for sending bits of data
TCP stands for Transmission Control Protoco,UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol .
TCP guarantees the recipient will receive the packets in order by numbering them.When using UDP, packets are just sent to the recipient. 
UDP is used when speed is desirable and error correction is not necessary. 

The ICMP:
ICMP differs from transport protocols such as TCP and UDP in that it is not typically used to exchange data between systems, 
nor is it regularly employed by end-user network applications (with the exception of some diagnostic tools like ping and traceroute)

The netmask are:
A netmask is a 32-bit mask used to divide an IP address into subnets and specify the network's available hosts.

The difference between  'switch' and a 'router:
The router forwards data packets along networks. It is connected to at least two networks, commonly two LANs or WANs or a LAN and its ISP's network.
In networks the switch is the device that filters and forwards packets between LAN segments. 
Switches operate at the data link layer (layer 2) and sometimes the network layer (layer 3) of the OSI Reference Model and therefore support any packet protocol. 

How cache and dns resolving url to ip address:

First, it checks the browser cache. The browser maintains a repository of DNS records for a fixed duration for websites you have previously visited. So, it is the first place to run a DNS query.

Second, the browser checks the OS cache. If it is not found in the browser cache, the browser would make a system call (i.e. gethostname on Windows) to your underlying computer OS to fetch the record since the OS also maintains a cache of DNS records.

Third, it checks the router cache. If it’s not found on your computer, the browser would communicate with the router that maintains its’ own cache of DNS records.

Fourth, it checks the ISP cache. If all steps fail, the browser would move on to the ISP. Your ISP maintains its’ own DNS server which includes a cache of DNS records which the browser would check with the last hope of finding your requested URL.
If the requested URL is not in the cache, ISP’s DNS server initiates a DNS query to find the IP address of the server

What ifconfig means 
lo0 = loopback
gif0 = Software Network Interface
stf0 = 6to4 tunnel interface
en0 = Ethernet 0
fw0 = Firewire
en1 = Ethernet 1
vmnet8 = Virtual Interface
vmnet1 = Virtual Interface
