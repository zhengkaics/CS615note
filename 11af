This class we have learn Configuration Management.
I understand two important knowledge of configuration management.
Idempotence and CAP Theorem.

Idempotence means no matter how many times we do the operation.
The result is same with do it one time.
But the idempotence does not guarantee efficiency.
So we only applied if we needed.
What I understand is our target is using CM to make system eventually consistent.
Design CM need follow idempotent rules to reach the target.

Another important knowledge is CAP Theorem 
Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance
CAP theorem not noly work on CM systems 
but also work on other distributed system like distributed database.
