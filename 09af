This class we learn what a good system tool should be.
A great system administration tools should follow some rules:
repeatability, reliability, regularity, flexibility 
And the documentation is necessary.
Because user need to read the document to know how to use the tools. 
The programming language is important,

scripting language:
automating very simple tasks
customization of user environment
often only suitable for one individual user 
usually eventually evolves into larger programs

programming language:
suitable for simple to moderately complex tasks 
results frequently used by a small base of users 
uses basic framework or common toolkits 
provides consistent interface

python is a great scripting language, it is not very fast in running.
But it is easy to programming and easy to control.


Regular Expressions is important skill for system administration
Because when we analyze the system log there may have thousands lines and that is diffcult to find the massage we need to check.
Ctrl + F can help us find some information in web page. but it is hard to used on log analyze.
And regular expression can help us easy and quick find the massage we need.
And I find a great website to test Regular Expressions
