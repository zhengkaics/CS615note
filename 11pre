This class we will learn configuration management
I have learn the entropy will increase when data is processed, files are created, modified, removed...
When a software need to install the configuration need to check any prerequest software or hardware is satisfied or not.
And need have massage of software behiver.
And CM system is not to make changes on a system.
And CM systems assert state.
Configuration management asserts state. 
To this end, it must reliably produce a defined state without side-effects and needs to be able to run under different circumstances, yet yield the same outcome. 
If you run your CM on an unconfigured system, it will produce the same end-result as if you run it repeatedly.
And CM needs to have support for the package manager in use on the target system.
