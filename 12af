After this class 
I understand salt hash is important.
Because hacker can use hashcode find your plaintext from rainbow table.
I have read some detail about md5 and RSA.
md5 is not safe because we have some way to make md5 collision now.
RSA secret key have expired data because use powerful computer can find 
the two large prime from their production.
