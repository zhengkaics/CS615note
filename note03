I have read some material the link are:

I this week I learn the system startup sequence and the Software installation concept.
the startup sequence are:
1 . The BIOS performs startup tasks specific to the actual hardware platform. 
And makesure the hardware which is necessary for boot is initialized correctly, 
the BIOS loads and executes the boot code from the configured boot device.
2 . The boot load the option of which device is first startup device option.
3 . Load kernel, start kernel.
4 . start init(), init get run-level.
5 . init run /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit
6 . init run etc/rc.d/rc.local
7 . run the process of login the user can login now.

About Software installation concept
RPM RedHat Package Manager is compiled Software we can install directly.
SRPM is Source RPM means the RPM include the source code of Software.
package and dependency management like YUM is a RPM-based distributions.
We can use package and dependency management easy install ,uninstall  and updata the software.
