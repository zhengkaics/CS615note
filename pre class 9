pre class 9
In this course we will learn writing system tools.
And I learn different programming language for different purpose.
Perl, PHP, Tcl, JavaScript, CoffeeScript for 
http/web server interfaces
CGI ”scripts” / server-side execution
CS615 - Aspects of System Administration
Slide 12
interface with/utilize APIs in a specific domain/vendor products
frequent cause of all sorts of security problems due to interface with user data / exposure on the internet

C, C++, Go, Rust for 
performance benefits
portability
sufficient low-levelness
systems understanding
fix/patch your other tools / the system

And I learn difference of sh,bash,csh,ksh,zsh
bash like kind of sh++. 
CSH is a fairly nice interactive shell that has syntax that looks a lot more like C than that of the Bourne Shell. Traditionally, it was considerably superior for interactive use than sh.
KSH,a platform for both interactive system control as well as shell script programming, providing far superior functionality to the Bourne Shell. In many cases, it is quite a bit faster
ZSH,One area in which it is dramatically powerful is in its ability to interactively evaluate and modify arguments. It can do command name completion, filename completion, and is extensible such that it can use programs to evaluate possible command completions.

And about Errors should never pass silently.
When I learn write html, I notice chrome can correct run the html code even the html is incomplate. I think the program error should be report to the developer.
And for user if it is not a big problem, the error can pass sliently.
