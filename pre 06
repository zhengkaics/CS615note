For prepare this class I have read material about telnet and know telnent is used for bidirectional interactive text-oriented communicatio with other machine.
And know because serious secuity concens we using ssh instead telnet.

SSH offers security mechanisms that protect the users against anyone with malicious intent while Telnet has no security measures whatsoever.
 

diff:
1. SSH and Telnet commonly serves the same purpose
2. SSH is more secure compared to Telnet
3. SSH encrypts the data while Telnet sends data in plain text
4. SSH uses a public key for authentication while Telnet does not use any authentication
5. SSH adds a bit more overhead to the bandwidth compared to Telnet
6. Telnet has been all but replaced by SSH in almost all uses
