What mechanisms exist to ascertain an email's authenticity?
Domain Keys Identified Mail, or DKIM, is a highly regarded email security system 
that can be used to independently authenticate the contents and sender of an email that uses it.

any formatting or character change to a message or many of its headers, no matter how small, will prevent a message from being validated.
