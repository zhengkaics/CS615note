cs615 notes
week1 in homework I meet some problem and solve them.
//problem I have meet and how to solve them.
After I create keypair
I use order
$aws ec2 describe-key-pairs --key-name cs615KeyPair.pem
error occurred (InvalidKeyPair.NotFound)
I search in forums.aws. 
And find the answer is the name of keypair shoud not include ".pem"

The run-instances order have subnet but I didnot know.
I read the run-instance description it have 
"[EC2-VPC] If you don't specify a subnet ID, we choose a default subnet from your default VPC for you. 
If you don't have a default VPC, you must specify a subnet ID in the request."
But I find the subnet information first time I decided using us-east-1e.
But when I launch error occurred
Your requested instance type (t1.micro) is not supported in your requested Availability Zone (us-east-1e).
I delete the --subnet-id part using the default , the instance successful runing.
I check the info show after launch the subnetId is subnet-615f353c that is us-east-1a.

The example of launch order in doc is t2-micro
I didnot know what mean t2-micro in the order.
I found it in aws instance-types
t2.micro 1 vCPU , 1 Memory (GiB) , EBS Only Storage (GB), Low to Moderate Networking Performance, Intel Xeon family Physical Processor ,Up to 3.3 Clock Speed (GHz)
But the error occurred when I launch the instance

An error occurred (InvalidParameterCombination) when calling the RunInstances operation: Virtualization type 'hvm' is required for instances of type 't2.micro'. 
Ensure that you are using an AMI with virtualization type 'hvm'. For more information, 
see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/virtualization_types.html
I found the AMI NetBSD 7.0 us-east-1(Virginia) is paravirtual not hvm that means I cannot using t2-micro.
I decided use t1-micro. 

after I successful launch instance. I cannot using ssh to log in instance.
After try many ways, I find I need sudo first.
