Class 10 Backup and Disaster Recovery / Monitoring
In this class we have learn Backups and Restore Basics
Because equipment failure, bozotic users, natural disaster, 
security breach, software bugs or other reason the data will loss.
That is why we need to backup the data to avoid those disaster destory our system.
And we have learn some backup strategy:
Mac OS X "Time Machine" strategy is 
First: automatically creates a full backup to separate device or NAS, 
recording (specifically) last-modified date of all directories.
Second: every hour backup the hardlinks of file not changed
and copy of files for those files have been changed.
//The changed file are determined by inspecting last-modified date of directories.
Thirdly saves hourly backups for 24 hours, daily backups for the past month, 
and weekly backups for everything older than a month.

That strategy can help us save space and give us more choice of versions.

ZFS snapshots is another backup tool.
