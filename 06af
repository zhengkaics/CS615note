This class I learn how to use telnet to connect to server on some port and request it for HTTP header of some web page.
And how to use tcpdump capture ad analyze packet.

And I learn differences between SSH and Telnet
SSH is more secure compared to Telnet.
SSH encrypts the data while Telnet sends data in plain text.
SSH uses a public key for authentication while Telnet does not use any authentication.
SSH adds a bit more overhead to the bandwidth compared to Telnet.
Telnet has been all but replaced by SSH in almost all uses.
SSH and Telnet commonly serves the same purpose.

And I learn some Protocol
ARP
Converting Network Protocol Addresses to 48-bit Ethernet Address for Transmission on Ethernet Hardware
ICMP ICMP6  TCP  UDP
ICMP differs from transport protocols such as TCP and UDP in that it is not typically used to exchange data between systems, nor is it regularly employed by end-user network applications.
