unix file system
read material link:

In this class and homework I learn how linux file system work and how unix find file in hard disk.
It based on super block, block and inode.
The system first read inode and file the file in which block, and then read those bolck one by one.
And the super bolck store the information of how many inode and bolck, how many used and not used and the file format.
And I learn many file command in the material link and learn how to attach and mount a volume and format it in aws.
And learn if two instance with different OS support same file system then the file in the volume could be across different OS instances.
And find in different the command is different.

Reason why file in same volume/filesystem can across different OS instance:
The user using Application Process to control files, and the Application Process using Virtual File System which in kernel to connect different filesystem.
The filesystem rules handle how to read and write data from storage device.
That is means if the OS support the filesystem, different filesystem have same interface to user.
Different OS can read file even the file is not created by it.
