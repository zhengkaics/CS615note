Unix group can help us easy control many users permissions.
If we need create many user accounts and they have same permissions, 
we need not give those user accounts permissions one by one, 
we can create a group and give this group permissions and add those user accounts in this group.

Limitations of Unix group carry
A UNIX user has a primary group, defined in the passwd database, but can also be a member of many other groups, defined in the groups database.
UNIX has a hardcoded limit of 16 groups a user can be a member of . 
This means that if we translate  clients into UNIX groups and you have access to multiple  clients, you'll be able to access only 16 of those clients at a time.



three types of access permissions: read, write, and execute.
using binary to represent the permissions of rwx, 100=4=r,10=2=w,1=1=x
7 = 4+2+1 = rwx
and the 777 , 
first 7 means the permissions of file owner.
second 7 means the permissions of users belonging to the owning group.
third 7 means the permissions of other users.
